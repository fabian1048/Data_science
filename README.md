Sample code for machine learning and deep learning
Data for the code can be found in the /Data folder 


*******************Absenteeism Analysis*****************************
The notebook goes through an example of analysing absenteeism in a company.
We try look into the data and identify people who are excessively absent and then try to predict it with various methods in machine learning and deep learning.


*******************Car Sales Regression*****************************
The notebook works through an example of predicting the prices of cars from the given data.
We try and do a feature selection by dropping some columns that seem redundant, then include them and see the changes in predictions.
We also move from using simple linear regressions with some regularizations to tree based methods then onto support vector machines and then finally a quick sequential deep learning model.

*******************Churn Analysis***********************************
We look through an example of customer churn in a company. We look into the various services provided, the cost customer pay and other things.
We then try and break the data into cohorts to get some deeper insights.
Finally we proceed into some predictions with machine learning based methods and then onto a simple deep learning method.

*******************Fandango Movie Review Analysis********************
The notebook takes a look into movie reviews for the fandango website. The goal here is to compare them with other sites like metacritic etc and see if there is any bias since fandango also sells tickets.
We tend to compare similar movie reviews across each site and come to a conclusion that fandango does indeed prop up their movies.

*******************Housing data Analysis*****************************
This is a bit similar to the car sales regression that was done before. Here we use the housing data and apply some preprocessing and data wrangling to clean up the data. 
We move onto the prediction part with various methods in the machine learning and deep learning categories.

*************Restaurant Review sentiment classification*********
We work in some NLP based methods here to try and classify sentiments from the reviews.
To start off we use a bag of words model based approach and then move on to using the hugging face transformer to see how a deep learning model can fair in the same data analysis.
